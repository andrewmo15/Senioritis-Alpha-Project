# HOW TO PLAY:

## Butcher Enemy ##
The Butcher enemy will patrol the hallway area outside of the rooms.
If the player is within his detection range (10 game units), the screen will start to redden,
and the buthcer will chase them, triggering a Game Over if caught.
If 10 seconds pass without getting caught, the Butcher will get tired and return to patrolling.
There will be a 5 second cooldown period afterwards where the player cannot get chased again.

## Room 1 Objective ##
The floor of this room will flash colors in a particular order.
You must press the buttons in the order of the colors that are flashed on the floor.

## Room 2 Objective ##
The words on the wall reveal a code. Decipher the code and enter it into the keypad to get a clue.

## Room 3 Objective ##
There are 4 butchers that will throw axes at you. Dodge them for 15 seconds to get the code!

## Room 4 Objective ##
The floor of this room will have a security code under a ball out of 16 balls.
You must push the balls to find the security code on the ground.

# PROBLEM AREAS:
	* If the Butcher enters a room during a chase and then gets tired,
  	  he will phase through walls to return to the hallway.
